# üìù Tracelet

## üåü Project Overview

**Tagline:** A lightweight analytics dashboard for Polkadot wallets ‚Äî track on-chain activity at a glance.

**Project Description:** Tracelet is a wallet activity feed and analytics tool designed for the Polkadot ecosystem. It offers users a clean, visual dashboard to monitor wallet events including token transfers, staking operations, governance participation, and contract interactions. Think of it as a "Polkadot Etherscan + Notion Activity Feed" hybrid ‚Äî designed for clarity and built with real users in mind.

The goal is to improve transparency and user trust in Polkadot dApps by making wallet activity easy to understand, audit, and share.

**Realtion to Polkadot:** racelet is being built natively for the Polkadot Hub and surrounding parachains. It leverages Substrate indexers (like SubQuery or Subsquid) to fetch wallet data, and will integrate directly with Polkadot.js wallets for a seamless experience.

**Why I'm Building This:** As a frontend engineer and Web3 builder, I've always found wallet activity to be scattered and unintuitive. I want to create a tool that simplifies this ‚Äî both for users and developers. I believe Tracelet can become a standard utility in the Polkadot toolchain, especially as activity grows.

### üîç Project Details

#### üîß Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** React + TailwindCSS + Typescript
- **Wallet Integration:** polkadot.js extension
- **Backend/Indexing:** SubQuery (or optionally, Subsquid)
- **Data Source:** Polkadot.js API or Subscan API for wallet activity
- **Analytics:** PostgreSQL or Supabase for user metrics (non-custodial and privacy-respecting)
- **Deployment:** Vercel or Vultr
- **Storage (Optional):** Supabase or SQLite (for bookmarks and local history)

#### üìö Architecture

- **Data Layer:** SubQuery indexing for historical and real-time wallet activity.
- **API Layer:** Lightweight Node.js/Express proxy server for backend filtering and pagination.
- **UI Layer:** Next.js frontend with dynamic components for wallet activity and timeline.

#### üìö Core Features:

- Wallet activity timeline
- Filter by event type (transfer, staking, governance, etc.)
- Shareable public activity URLs
- Event aggregation charts and basic analytics

üß™ MVP / Prior Work
Currently in ideation. No public code yet ‚Äî development will begin after grant approval.

üñºÔ∏è Mockups / UI Inspiration
Inspired by apps like [Zapper](https://zapper.xyz/) and DeBank feed, but simplified. Clean timeline UI with event icons and descriptions.

üìâ Limitations
- Tracelet is not a block explorer
- It won‚Äôt index its own data at launch ‚Äî will rely on existing APIs
- It won‚Äôt support every parachain at launch ‚Äî priority will be given to Polkadot Hub + top parachains
- No write interactions or contract deployment features


### üß© Ecosystem Fit

#### Where it fits

Tracelet sits at the intersection of tooling and analytics ‚Äî a complementary utility to wallet extensions and block explorers. It enables both power users and casual users to track their activity without needing to dig through raw extrinsics.

#### Target Audience

- Individual Polkadot users
- Delegators and nominators
- Governance participants
- Devs needing a tool to help users track wallet activity across dApps

#### Needs it solves

- Makes wallet activity human-readable
- Offers simple analytics to help users see what they‚Äôve done on-chain
- Gives transparency tools to small teams building in the ecosystem

#### Similar Projects:
There are analytics dashboards for Ethereum (like Etherscan's portfolio, DeBank, Zapper), but nothing similarly user-focused in Polkadot. Subscan exists but is geared toward power users. Tracelet will be clean, focused, and lightweight ‚Äî ideal for regular users.

### Team's experience

I‚Äôm a frontend engineer with over 4 years of hands-on experience building scalable, user-focused web applications. My work spans real-time UIs, Web3 wallet integrations, and blockchain-based platforms. I've worked with tools like React, Next.js, TailwindCSS, and integrated Web3 functionality such as wallet authentication and on-chain data displays.

I‚Äôve also authored technical guides for the Celo Foundation, covering smart contract deployment and governance participation ‚Äî an experience that deepened my understanding of blockchain protocols and their user-layer implications.

Now, I‚Äôm excited to apply these skills to the Polkadot ecosystem by building a tool that improves transparency and UX for everyone interacting with wallets and dApps.

## üìä Development Status

The Tracelet repository has been created and initial planning is underway. I‚Äôm currently outlining the architecture and defining the user flow and component structure. I haven‚Äôt begun development or indexing yet, but I‚Äôve identified the tools and APIs I‚Äôll be using ‚Äî including SubQuery for indexing and Polkadot.js for wallet address handling.

Once the grant is approved, I plan to begin with the wallet activity feed MVP and deliver an open-source, fully documented first milestone within the first 3 weeks.

## üîÆ Future Plans

After the Fast-Grant, I plan to:

- Expand Tracelet to support more parachains and ecosystem wallets
- Add notification support (activity alerts via Telegram or email)
- Turn Tracelet into a developer tool ‚Äî dApp teams can embed wallet feed components inside their apps
- Seek follow-up funding from the main Polkadot grants program or ecosystem VCs
- eventually open Tracelet to contributors and possibly create a plugin system for custom events

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Additional Information

- The Tracelet repository has been created, but development has not yet started. This proposal is meant to secure initial funding to begin building the MVP.
- This is a solo project, and no other teams have contributed to it.
- This is my first grant application within the Polkadot ecosystem, and I‚Äôm excited to begin contributing and learning as a builder in this community.
